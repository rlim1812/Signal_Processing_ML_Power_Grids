# Signal_Processing_ML_Power_Grids
This is a project involving using signal processing and machine learning analysis techniques in order to analyze signal data from power grid systems and classify whether or not the signals are good or bad (with bad signals corresponding to signals that generate partial discharges and lead to faults/power outages).
